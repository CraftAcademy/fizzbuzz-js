# Think Aloud Protocol

The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an excercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his mind as he complete the task. This might include what he is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. Sessions should be recorded so that coaches can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.
